# Service-Learning-Mobile-Time-Tracker
Version 0.5 by Team Null

# About
SL Time Tracker is a cross-platform react-native app that was developed by Team Null during the Fall 2016 semester of CS4500 at Northeastern University. It was created for Northeastern's Service Learning Department, as a user-friendly and easily accessible tool for students in a service learning project to track their hours worked. The app provides an interface for students to register for their classes, select their projects, and record the hours that they worked on each project. It is strictly a student-facing app; instructors and faculty are expected to use the web version. SL Time Tracker has been tested on Android 7.0 (Nougat) and iOS 10.0.
